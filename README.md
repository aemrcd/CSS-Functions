## **CSS Features**

## **1. Basic Use of Container Queries**  

- #### This will show what is the difference between the three Container components in CSS 
- #### To try this process, open `Container_quiries.html`  in the *template folder* or create your own HTML file.*

 <img src="./static/img/Container.gif">

- **Normal Container:** The image remains the same.
- **Inline-Size Container:** The image resizes based on the  container's width.
- **Size Container:** The image resizes based on both width and height.


## **2. Basic Use of grid**  

<img src="./static/img/Gridexample.png">

- `grid-template-columns:` Arranges 3 cards side-by-side in one row.
- `grid-template-rows:` Keeps the content organized inside each card:
   - image at the top
   - Text in the middle.
   - Buttomat the bottom.
- For better explanation open `Grid&Subgrid.html`  in the *template folder* or create your own HTML file.* 


- *if you are having trouble understanding the function there is a comment to fully understand the code it self*


## **3. Use of `align-content`**
